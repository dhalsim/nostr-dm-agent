# Post-agent lint behavior (agent mode)

When the bot runs in `agent` mode:

- After each agent response, the bot runs `npm run lint` for the active workspace target (`parent` or `bot`).
- The lint result is appended to the response sent to the user.
- If lint fails, the bot performs one additional agent round and sends lint output as feedback.
- The user receives the combined output after this lint step (and optional fix round).

## Agent expectations

- Assume lint may run immediately after your response in `agent` mode.
- If you receive a follow-up message prefixed with `[Post-edit lint feedback]`, treat it as authoritative runtime feedback and fix issues directly.
- Provide a concise final summary after applying lint-driven fixes.
